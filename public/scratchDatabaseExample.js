      'School of Conjuration': {desc: 'The School of Conjuration favors spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence.'},
      'School of Divination': {desc: 'The School of Divination strives to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernement, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.'},
      'School of Enchantment': {desc: 'The School of Enchantment uses magic to entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms, others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service.'},
